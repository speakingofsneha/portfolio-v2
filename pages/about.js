                The worst part however, is how hard it is to write a bio because I&apos;m constantly changing, but I think I know who I am...

                an artist, designer, writer, developer and a very cool person trust me on this!!!! I&apos;ve worn many hats but to me, the label isn&apos;t what matters.
                Pixels, &quot;words&quot;, &lt;code&gt;, and their interactions are mediums through which we stumble across new perspectives; essentially if I had to explain myself and the work I do to a 10, 30 and 70 year old collectively, I draw from life and try to make things that change our stories for the better.
